1. Start by defining the function with its parameters (target, start, end, numList).

4. In each iteration, get the current element in numList at the current index.

2. The fifth line of the code, ""new_list = []"", should be the second line of the function. This creates a new empty list that will be used to store the strings from str_list that have a length greater than 3.
3. The third line of the code, ""for word in str_list:"", should be the third line of the function. This starts a loop that goes through each string in str_list.
4. The fourth line of the code, ""if len(word) > 3:"", should be the fourth line of the function. This starts an if statement that checks if the length of the current string (word) is greater than 3.
